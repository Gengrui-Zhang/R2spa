\usage{
compute_fscore(
  y,
  lambda,
  theta,
  psi,
  nu = NULL,
  alpha = NULL,
  method = c("regression", "Bartlett"),
  acov = FALSE,
  fs_matrices = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{An N x p matrix where each row is a response vector. If there
is only one observation, it should be a matrix of one row.}

\item{lambda}{A p x q matrix of factor loadings.}

\item{theta}{A p x p matrix of unique variance-covariances.}

\item{psi}{A q x q matrix of latent factor variance-covariances.}

\item{nu}{A vector of length p of measurement intercepts.}

\item{alpha}{A vector of length q of latent means.}

\item{method}{A character string indicating the method for computing factor
scores. Currently, only "regression" is supported.}

\item{acov}{Logical indicating whether the asymptotic covariance matrix
of factor scores should be returned as an attribute.}

\item{fs_matrices}{Logical indicating whether covariances of the error
portion of factor scores (\code{av_efs}), factor score
loading matrix (\eqn{A}; \code{fsA}) and intercept vector
(\eqn{b}; \code{fsb}) should be returned.
The loading and intercept matrices are the implied
loadings and intercepts by the model when using the
factor scores as indicators of the latent variables.
If \code{TRUE}, these matrices will be added as
attributes.}
}
\value{
An N x p matrix of factor scores.
