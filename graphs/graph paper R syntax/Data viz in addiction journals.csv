Notes/Conclusions,,,,,,,,
"Searched 5 addiction journals for SEM in abstract or keyword list for 2015-2016 period.  This is an under-representation of all addiction SEM research (e.g., other journals, SEM research without SEM in keyword/abstract), but an informal starting point for looking at current practices for reporting SEM resutls.",,,,,,,,
"Path diagrams are often elegant, precise, beautiful in a lot of ways.  To be clear, we are not criticizing their form or contributions, but rather we are highlighting that path diagrams are often the primary mode used for communicating rusults about data and they are inherently complex..",,,,,,,,
Vast majority of SEM papers used path diagrams and tables.  Very few provided visualizations that quantify effects outside of path diagrams.,,,,,,,,
