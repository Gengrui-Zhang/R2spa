Description: `R2spa` is a free and open source R package that performs two-stage path analysis (2S-PA).
    With 2S-PA, researchers can perform path analysis by first obtaining factor scores and then adjusting for measurement errors 
    using estimates of observation-specific reliability or standard error of those factor scores. As a viable alternative to SEM, 
    2S-PA has been shown to give equally-good estimates as SEM in relatively simple models and large sample sizes, 
    as well as to give more accurate parameter estimates, has better control of Type I error rates, 
    and has substantially less convergence problems in more complex models or small sample sizes.
