A theoretical background is presented. Then evidence is provided to support the idea that emerging adulthood is a distinct period demographically, subjectively, and in terms of identity explorations. How emerging adulthood differs from adolescence and young adulthood is explained. Finally, a cultural context for the idea of emerging adulthood is outlined, and it is specified that emerging adulthood exists only in cultures that allow young people a prolonged period of independent role exploration during the late teens and twenties.

  abstract = {Minimal measurement error (reliability) during the collection of interval- and ratio-type data is critically important to sports medicine research. The main components of measurement error are systematic bias (e.g. general learning or fatigue effects on the tests) and random error due to biological or mechanical variation. Both error components should be meaningfully quantified for the sports physician to relate the described error to judgements regarding 'analytical goals' (the requirements of the measurement tool for effective practical use) rather than the statistical significance of any reliability indicators. Methods based on correlation coefficients and regression provide an indication of 'relative reliability'. Since these methods are highly influenced by the range of measured values, researchers should be cautious in: (i) concluding acceptable relative reliability even if a correlation is above 0.9; (ii) extrapolating the results of a test-retest correlation to a new sample of individuals involved in an experiment; and (iii) comparing test-retest correlations between different reliability studies. Methods used to describe 'absolute reliability' include the standard error of measurements (SEM), coefficient of variation (CV) and limits of agreement (LOA). These statistics are more appropriate for comparing reliability between different measurement tools in different studies. They can be used in multiple retest studies from ANOVA procedures, help predict the magnitude of a 'real' change in individual athletes and be employed to estimate statistical power for a repeated-measures experiment. These methods vary considerably in the way they are calculated and their use also assumes the presence (CV) or absence (SEM) of heteroscedasticity. Most methods of calculating SEM and CV represent approximately 68\% of the error that is actually present in the repeated measurements for the 'average' individual in the sample. LOA represent the test-retest differences for 95\% of a population. The associated Bland-Altman plot shows the measurement error schematically and helps to identify the presence of heteroscedasticity. If there is evidence of heteroscedasticity or non-normality, one should logarithmically transform the data and quote the bias and random error as ratios. This allows simple comparisons of reliability across different measurement tools. It is recommended that sports clinicians and researchers should cite and interpret a number of statistical methods for assessing reliability. We encourage the inclusion of the LOA method, especially the exploration of heteroscedasticity that is inherent in this analysis. We also stress the importance of relating the results of any reliability statistic to 'analytical goals' in sports medicine.},

  abstract = {"Structural Equations with Latent Variables" is a comprehensive treatment of the general structural equation system better known as the LISREL model. The book serves three purposes. First, it demonstrates the generality of this model. Rather than treating path analysis, recursive and nonrecursive models, classical econometrics, and confirmatory factor analysis as unique, they are treated as special cases of a common model. The second purpose is to emphasize the application of these techniques. Empirical examples appear throughout. Several chapters contain some of the LISREL or EQS programs the author used to obtain the results for the empirical examples. Finally, the book explores the crucial role played by substantive expertise in most stages of the modeling process.  "Structural Equations with Latent Variables" fills the gap existing in the treatment of this subject between introductory texts and specialized papers. It provides social scientists, market researchers, applied statisticians, other analysts, and graduate students with a thorough examination of LISREL/structural equation models. At the same time it presents new material on measurement reliability and validity, overall fit indices, model identification, and other topics.

The second is overall error which involves the fit of the model, with parameter values estimated from the sample, to the population covariance matrix. Measures of the two types of error are proposed and point and interval estimates of the measures are suggested. These measures take the number of parameters in the model into account in order to avoid penalizing parsimonious models. Practical difficulties associated with the usual tests of exact fit or a model are discussed and a test of ``close fit'' of a model is suggested.},

  abstract = {Objectives. Previous research has found that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) individuals are at risk for a variety of mental health disorders. We examined the extent to which a recent experience of a major discriminatory event may contribute to poor mental health among LGBT persons. Methods. Data were derived from a cross-sectional strata-cluster survey of adults in Hennepin County, Minnesota, who identified as LGBT (n = 472) or heterosexual (n = 7,412). Results. Compared to heterosexuals, LGBT individuals had poorer mental health (higher levels of psychological distress, greater likelihood of having a diagnosis of depression or anxiety, greater perceived mental health needs, and greater use of mental health services), more substance use (higher levels of binge drinking, greater likelihood of being a smoker and greater number of cigarettes smoked per day), and were more likely to report unmet mental healthcare needs. LGBT individuals were also more likely to report having experienced a major incident of discrimination over the past year than heterosexual individuals. Although perceived discrimination was associated with almost all of the indicators of mental health and utilization of mental health care that we examined, adjusting for discrimination did not significantly reduce mental health disparities between heterosexual and LGBT persons. Conclusion. LGBT individuals experienced more major discrimination and reported worse mental health than heterosexuals, but discrimination did not account for this disparity. Future research should explore additional forms of discrimination and additional stressors associated with minority sexual orientation that may account for these disparities.},

The evaluation is based on a theoretical distinction between the structural model (the set of equations relating theoretical constructs to each other) and the measurement model (the set of equations relating the theoretical constructs to the observed measures). It is concluded that hierarchical regression analysis is inadequate for determining whether the structural model is additive or multiplicative for 2 reasons: First, an additive structural model may produce multiplicative effects through a nonlinear measurement model. Second, a multiplicative structural model may produce nondetectable multiplicative effects because of multiplicative measurement error. Some alternatives to hierarchical regression analysis are described. (35 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The present study examined the mediation effect of adolescents' self-esteem in the association between socioeconomic status and life satisfaction, and whether this mediating process was moderated by optimism. A sample of 668 Chinese adolescents (mean age=14.53years, SD=1.81) completed anonymous questionnaires regarding SES, life satisfaction, self-esteem and optimism. Multiple regression analyses revealed that the association between SES and life satisfaction was mediated by self-esteem. Moreover, the mediating effect of self-esteem was moderated by optimism, with the mediating effect being stronger for individuals with low optimism than for those with high optimism. These findings can be beneficial to our understanding of how and when SES impacts adolescents' well-being. Moreover, the present study highlighted the importance of using the organism-environment interaction to explore potential protective factors for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. A person cannot choose where he comes from (e.g., low socioeconomic status), but can choose whom he wants to be (e.g., optimist).},

Yet, the extent to which the results extend to general forms of discrimination as well as multiple second-generation immigrant ethnic groups remains underexamined. This article assessed the mediating role of self-esteem in the relation between general forms of perceived discrimination and depression symptoms among second-generation immigrant adolescents and assessed the extent to which the relations were invariant across ethnic sub-groups. Analyses were based on data from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study over two periods spanning adolescence (N\,=\,4288; Mage\,=\,14 and 17). The mediating role of self-esteem was tested via path analysis for the full sample, and multiple-group path analyses compared these results across White, Black, Asian, Hispanic, and other (multiracial) immigrants. Indirect effects were obtained via 5000 bootstrapped replications. In the full sample, the relation between discrimination and depression was mediated by self-esteem with approximately 30\% of the total effect mediated. Said mediated relation was only confirmed among White and Asian sub-groups, with 27\% and 49\% of the total effects mediated, respectively. The results suggest that the process by which discrimination relates to mental health may vary between immigrant racial/ethnic sub-groups. In addition, the results highlight the value of considering broader categorizations of perceived discrimination beyond race or ethnicity to understand complexities associated with intersecting marginalized identities among this population.},

Failing to account for violations of these assumptions, such as not modeling measurement error or omitting a common cause of the effects in the model, can bias the parameter estimates of the mediated effect. When the independent variable is perfectly reliable, for example when participants are randomly assigned to levels of treatment, measurement error in the mediator tends to underestimate the mediated effect, while the omission of a confounding variable of the mediator-to-outcome relation tends to overestimate the mediated effect. Violations of these two assumptions often co-occur, however, in which case the mediated effect could be overestimated, underestimated, or even, in very rare circumstances, unbiased. To explore the combined effect of measurement error and omitted confounders in the same model, the effect of each violation on the single-mediator model is first examined individually. Then the combined effect of having measurement error and omitted confounders in the same model is discussed. Throughout, an empirical example is provided to illustrate the effect of violating these assumptions on the mediated effect. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {A two-step process is commonly used to evaluate data--model fit of latent variable path models, the first step addressing the measurement portion of the model and the second addressing the structural portion of the model. Unfortunately, even if the fit of the measurement portion of the model is perfect, the ability to assess the fit within the structural portion is affected by the quality of the factor--variable relations within the measurement model. The result is that models with poorer quality measurement appear to have better data--model fit, whereas models with better quality measurement appear to have worse data--model fit. The current article illustrates this phenomenon across different classes of fit indices, discusses related structural assessment problems resulting from issues of measurement quality, and endorses a supplemental modeling step evaluating the structural portion of the model in isolation from the measurement model.},

This has led to creating one nomological network for grandiose narcissism and one nomological network for self-esteem. However, some evidence shows that grandiose narcissism and self-esteem interact to predict outcomes. Hence, some features of the nomological networks of one construct (e.g., self-esteem) might depend on levels of the other (e.g., grandiose narcissism). To advance understanding of this implication, we related the grandiose narcissism*self-esteem interaction to parameters previously used to describe grandiose narcissism and self-esteem as independent constructs (i.e., Five Factor Model [FFM] traits, dark-personality constructs, and impulsivity constructs). Regarding FFM traits, grandiose narcissism*self-esteem predicted (a) higher Agreeableness, (b) higher Conscientiousness, and (c) higher Openness. Regarding dark-personality constructs, grandiose narcissism*self-esteem predicted (a) lower psychopathy, (b) lower Machiavellianism, and (c) lower vulnerable narcissism. Regarding impulsivity constructs, grandiose narcissism*self-esteem predicted (a) lower Negative Urgency, (b) lower Positive Urgency, (c) lower lack of Premeditation, and (d) lower lack of Perseverance.

The design compared traditional regression analysis (which ignores measurement error) with approaches based on latent variable structural equation models that used maximum-likelihood and weighted least squares estimation criteria.

Current work evaluated the salience of GD's negative effects across different cultures and outcome measures and tested the differential impact of GD within the household (GD-P), and GD within social institutions (GD-S). Data from four previous studies on American Indians, Palestinians, and clients of mental health clinics in Egypt and torture survivors in the US were re-analyzed. All the four studies used the same measure of GD, and trauma types, with similar and different outcome measures which allowed measuring the stability of the effects across different cultures and different outcome measures. Partial correlation and path analysis were conducted. GD predicted increased PTSD, cumulative trauma disorders, general anxiety, annihilation anxiety, and decreased in self-esteem, general assessed functioning. Results suggested that linear and non-linear effects of GD supported its cumulative dynamics. GD-S was associated with more negative outcomes than GD-P. Further, internalizing and appraising GD as positive mediated by resulted decrease in self-esteem, predicted negative mental health outcomes, while negative appraisal did not predict any negative change. Positive appraisal of GD may be a negative coping strategy. The implications of results for trauma theory, counseling and social justice, and for future research were discussed.

Rex is a scholar of SEM and has a special gift---of being able to communicate complex statistical concepts in language that all readers can grasp. The accessible style of writing and the many pedagogical features of the book (e.g., chapter-end annotated reading lists, exercises with answers) make it a "must have" for any user of SEM. It is a resource that keeps improving and expanding with each new edition and is the resource I recommend first on this subject---whether the question comes from a beginner or an experienced user. As a scholar of modern statistical practice and techniques. Rex has studied the developments and advances in the world of SEM generally, and he has covered "hot" topics, such as Pearl's structural causal modeling. His coverage of Pearl's graph theory approach to causal reasoning, as many of the reviewers of prepublication drafts of the fourth edition have also noted, is both easy to understand and comprehensive. It's so good, he ought to get a prize for best in presentation! In this new edition, he takes us through causal mediation analysis, conditional process modeling, and confirmatory factor analysis with categorical indicators. Other additions to this masterpiece of pedagogy include insightful discussions of significance testing, the use of bootstrap estimation, and the principles of measurement theory. Although Rex suggests in his Introduction that no single book can cover all of SEM, his book is about as thorough as they come. His didactic approach is refreshing and engaging, and the breadth and depth of material covered is simply impressive. As he notes and you will feel. Rex is a researcher talking to you as a fellow researcher, carefully explaining in conceptually driven terms the logic and principles that underlie the world of SEM. The wealth of examples provide entry points for researchers across a broad array of disciplines. This book will speak to you regardless of your field or specific area of expertise.

  abstract = {In path analysis, using composite scores without adjustment for measurement unreliability and violations of factorial invariance across groups lead to biased estimates of path coefficients. Although joint modeling of measurement and structural models can theoretically yield consistent structural association estimates, estimating a model with many variables is often impractical in small samples. A viable alternative is two-stage path analysis (2S-PA), where researchers first obtain factor scores and the corresponding individual-specific reliability coefficients, and then use those factor scores to analyze structural associations while accounting for their unreliability. The current paper extends 2S-PA to also account for partial invariance. Two simulation studies show that 2S-PA outperforms joint modeling in terms of model convergence, the efficiency of structural parameter estimation, and confidence interval coverage, especially in small samples and with categorical indicators. We illustrate 2S-PA by reanalyzing data from a multiethnic study that predicts drinking problems using college-related alcohol beliefs.},

  abstract = {When estimating path coefficients among psychological constructs measured with error, structural equation modeling (SEM), which simultaneously estimates the measurement and structural parameters, is generally regarded as the gold standard. In practice, however, researchers usually first compute composite scores or factor scores, and use those as observed variables in a path analysis, for purposes of simplifying the model or avoiding model convergence issues. Whereas recent approaches, such as reliability adjustment methods and factor score regression, has been proposed to mitigate the bias induced by ignoring measurement error in composite/factor scores with continuous indicators, those approaches are not yet applicable to models with categorical indicators. In this article, we introduce the two-stage path analysis (2S-PA) with definition variables as a general framework for path modeling to handle categorical indicators, in which estimation of factor scores and path coefficients are separated. It thus allows for different estimation methods in the measurement and the structural path models and easier diagnoses of violations of model assumptions. We conducted three simulation studies, ranging from latent regression to mediation analysis with categorical indicators, and showed that 2S-PA generally produced similar estimates to those using SEM in large samples, but gave better convergence rates, less standard error bias, and better control of Type I error rates in small samples. We illustrate 2S-PA using data from a national data set, and show how researchers can implement it in Mplus and OpenMx. Possible extensions and future directions of 2S-PA are discussed.

  abstract = {The purpose of this investigation is to compare a new (double-mean-centering) strategy to estimating latent interactions in structural equation models with the (single) mean-centering strategy (Marsh, Wen, \& Hau, 2004, 2006) and the orthogonalizing strategy (Little, Bovaird, \& Widaman, 2006; Marsh et al., 2007). A key benefit of the orthogonalizing strategy is that it eliminated the need to estimate a mean structure as required by the mean-centering strategy, but required a potentially cumbersome 2-step estimation procedure. In contrast, the double-mean-centering strategy eliminates both the need for the mean structure and the cumbersome 2-stage estimation procedure. Furthermore, although the orthogonalizing and double-mean-centering strategies are equivalent when all indicators are normally distributed, the double-mean-centering strategy is superior when this normality assumption is violated. In summary, we recommend that applied researchers wanting to estimate latent interaction effects use the double-mean-centering strategy instead of either the single-mean-centering or orthogonalizing strategies, thus allowing them to ignore the cumbersome mean structure.},

Research on Type D personality serves as a good case study for that matter. In Study 1, we fitted a multivariate interaction model to predict depression and anxiety with Type D personality, operationalized as an interaction between its two subcomponents negative affectivity (NA) and social inhibition (SI). We constructed this interaction according to four approaches: (1) sum score product; (2) single product indicator; (3) matched product indicators; and (4) latent moderated structural equations (LMS). In Study 2, we compared these interaction models in a simulation study by assessing for each method the bias and precision of the estimated interaction effect under varying conditions. In Study 1, all methods showed a significant Type D effect on both depression and anxiety, although this effect diminished after including the NA and SI quadratic effects. Study 2 showed that the LMS approach performed best with respect to minimizing bias and maximizing power, even when item scores were ordinal and skewed. However, when latent traits were skewed LMS resulted in more false-positive conclusions, while the Matched PI approach adequately controlled the false-positive rate.},

  abstract = {This chapter mostly focuses on techniques to analyze interaction effects when at least one of the predictors is a latent variable with multiple indicators. However, for didactical reasons, we begin by briefly discussing multiple moderated regression (Cohen, Cohen, West, \& Aiken, 2003) as the dominant technique for analyzing interactions between observed variables. We believe it is important that the applied researcher has basic knowledge in understanding issues in testing manifest interactions before proceeding to more sophisticated latent variable models for interactions. The presentation of the latent variable models is structured as follows. We first deal with interactions between a categorical manifest variable (e.g., gender or immigrant status) and a latent variable. Multigroup structural equation models are appropriate for analyzing this type of interaction effect, if the manifest variable is truly categorical. The main focus of our chapter is on structural equation models for interactions between two latent variables that are each measured with multiple indicators. We introduce three families of approaches to the analyses of these models: (1) Product indicator approaches that identify, a latent product variable with products of the indicators of the original latent variables, (2) distribution analytic approaches that estimate the latent interaction directly, and (3) Bayesian approaches using prior information. We give a brief historical overview of the development of the product indicator approaches culminating in the flexible and easy-to-implement unconstrained approach (Marsh, Wen, \& Hau, 2004). We then discuss in more detail some of the issues relating to specifying latent interaction models with the unconstrained approach. In particular, we will discuss issues relating to building the product indicators, transforming the indicator, variables for easy model specification and obtaining a standardized solution with appropriate standard errors. Next, we introduce distribution analytic approaches and discuss their merits relative to each other and to the product indicator approaches. Finally, we briefly illustrate the Bayesian approach to latent interactions. Our chapter concludes with further directions for research on latent variable interactions, particularly the assessment of model fit, the consequences and estimation of quadratic effects, and interactions in multilevel structural equation models.

  abstract = {Latent variables are common in psychological research. Research questions involving the interaction of two variables are likewise quite common. Methods for estimating and interpreting interactions between latent variables within a structural equation modeling framework have recently become available. The latent moderated structural equations (LMS) method is one that is built into Mplus software. The potential utility of this method is limited by the fact that the models do not produce traditional model fit indices, standardized coefficients, or effect sizes for the latent interaction, which renders model fitting and interpretation of the latent variable interaction difficult. This article compiles state-of-the-science techniques for assessing LMS model fit, obtaining standardized coefficients, and determining the size of the latent interaction effect in order to create a tutorial for new users of LMS models. The recommended sequence of model estimation and interpretation is demonstrated via a substantive example and a Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, extensions of this method are discussed, such as estimating quadratic effects of latent factors and interactions between latent slope and intercept factors, which hold significant potential for testing and advancing developmental theories.},

Researchers are increasingly aware that bullying occurs within social contexts and is often witnessed by others in the organization, such as bystanders. However, we know little about how bystanders' responses influence outcomes for those exposed to bullying. In this multilevel study, involving 572 employees within 55 work groups, we explore how bystanders' passive (e.g., inaction) and active constructive (e.g., defending the target) responses to bullying can affect targets' somatic symptoms and work engagement. Drawing from Job-Demands Resource theory, we propose that passive and active constructive bystanders can worsen or buffer bullying's effects on these well-being outcomes, respectively. Specifically, we propose that passive bystanders can act as further demands for targets to cope with, leading to demand accumulation, while active constructive bystanders can act as resources. We found that exposure to workplace bullying was associated with somatic symptoms and low work engagement. The number of passive and active constructive bystanders in the target's work group moderated the relationship between exposure to bullying and engagement. In particular, with larger numbers of passive bystanders, the negative relationship of bullying exposure with engagement strengthened. Conversely, with a higher number of active constructive bystanders, bullying's negative relationship with engagement was mitigated. However, there was no moderating effect for somatic symptoms. This study contributes as the first empirical test of whether bystander behavior shapes the consequences of bullying for targets and provides a novel, group-level perspective to the bullying bystander literature.

  abstract = {Racial discrimination continues to be a major issue, particularly in the lives of minorities. In the United States, racial discrimination significantly influences many aspects of minorities' lives such as physical health, psychological health, access to jobs, and access to higher education. In this research, discrimination is conceptualized as a psychological stressor in the lives of minority adolescents since it poses a risk to healthy adolescent development; it can lead to feelings of helplessness, derogation, and demoralization. Using a cross-sectional sample of 618 African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans, and drawing on the integrative model for the study of developmental competencies in minority children, risk and resilience, social identity, and intersectionality, this paper examines (a) the relationship between racial discrimination and mental health problems of pre-adolescents and adolescents, (b) the moderating role of the importance of racial/ethnic identity, religious importance, and other support factors, (c) the moderating influence of gender and (d) the moderating influence of neighborhood factors. Results indicate that worrying about discrimination, having a negative future outlook, high levels of policing in the neighborhood, poverty, and experiences of violence, increased depression. In contrast, importance of ethnicity, having a close relationship with parents, and the availability of services for youths, reduced depression for adolescents. In addition, experiences of violence moderated the effect of discrimination on depression for Hispanic girls only. Results for aggression indicate that negative future outlook, and experiences of violence, significantly increased aggression, while importance of ethnicity, and having a close relationship with parents decreased aggression. In addition, importance of ethnicity moderated the effect of parental closeness, while the availability of services for youths, moderated the effect of worrying about discrimination for African-American girls only. Results for withdrawal, indicate that worrying about discrimination, having a negative future outlook, high levels of policing in the neighborhood, and experiences of violence increased withdrawal. In contrast, importance of ethnicity, importance of religion, and having a close relationship with parents, reduced withdrawal for adolescents. For African-American boys only, the importance of religion moderated the effect of discrimination, while the importance of ethnicity moderated the effect of parental closeness. For Hispanic girls only, the availability of services for youths moderated the effect of discrimination. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Although originally constructed as a Guttman-type scale (i.e., items with an ordinal pattern on the attribute), most researchers use a 4-point response format ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale is the standard measure of self-esteem in psychological research. The scale provides a short, straightforward, and convenient method for measuring global self-esteem. Because self-esteem is a traitlike construct, this scale may be of interest to researchers as a moderator variable in research rather than a dependent variable. For example, research could examine how precourse differences in self-esteem are related to student involvement in different types of service settings, how students deal with ambiguities and frustration during service activities, or satisfaction with the service learning course. Temporal consistency: Fleming and Courtney (1984) reported a 1-week test-retest reliability of .82. Internal consistency: Fleming and Courtney (1984) reported a coefficient alpha of .88. Factor structure: Hensley (1977) reported a unidimensional factor structure. Convergent Validity Reynolds (1988) found a .44 correlation between Rosenberg's Self- Esteem Scale and the Academic Self-Concept Scale. (PsycTests Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Estimating interactions using latent variables provides additional power to detect effects over testing interactions in regression. However, when predictors are modeled as latent variables, estimating and testing interactions requires additional steps beyond the models used for regression. We review methods of estimating and testing latent variable interactions with a focus on product indicator methods. Product indicator methods of examining latent interactions provide an accurate method to estimate and test latent interactions and can be implemented in any latent variable modeling software package. Significant latent interactions require additional steps (plotting and probing) to interpret interaction effects. We demonstrate how these methods can be easily implemented using functions in the semTools package with models fit using the lavaan package in R, and we illustrate how these methods work using an applied example concerning teacher stress and testing.},

  abstract = {To assess the reliability of congeneric tests, specifically designed reliability measures have been proposed. This paper emphasizes that such measures rely on a unidimensionality hypothesis, which can neither be confirmed nor rejected when there are only three test parts, and will invariably be rejected when there are more than three test parts. Jackson and Agunwamba's (1977) greatest lower bound to reliability is proposed instead. Although this bound has a reputation for overestimating the population value when the sample size is small, this is no reason to prefer the unidimensionality-based reliability. Firstly, the sampling bias problem of the glb does not play a role when the number of test parts is small, as is often the case with congeneric measures. Secondly, glb and unidimensionality based reliability are often equal when there are three test parts, and when there are more test parts, their numerical values are still very similar. To the extent that the bias problem of the greatest lower bound does play a role, unidimensionality-based reliability is equally affected. Although unidimensionality and reliability are often thought of as unrelated, this paper shows that, from at least two perspectives, they act as antagonistic concepts. A measure, based on the same framework that led to the greatest lower bound, is discussed for assessing how close is a set of variables to unidimensionality. It is the percentage of common variance that can be explained by a single factor. An empirical example is given to demonstrate the main points of the paper.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Two perspectives are offered on the transition outcomes of youth with emotional disturbances (ED) using data from the National Longitudinal Transition Study (NLTS) and the National Longitudinal Transition Study-2 (NLTS2). The first perspective compares two cohorts of youth ages 18-21 who were out of high school up to 4 years in 1990 and 2005 on their rates of high school completion, postsecondary education enrollment, employment, independent living, and criminal justice system involvement. The second perspective provides similar information from the final wave of NLTS2 data collection (2009), when young adults were ages 21-25. METHODS: Using nationally representative interview and survey data, descriptive statistics are provided for outcomes at each time point. RESULTS: Significant increases over time are apparent in rates of high school completion, postsecondary education, and arrest, and there was a significant decline in employment. Analyses of young adults with ED in 2009 show that 82.5 percent had completed high school, and 53 percent had had some postsecondary education. Although 91.2 percent had been employed at some time since high school, 49.6 percent were employed when interviewed; 63.1 percent had lived independently, 60.5 percent had been arrested, and 44.2 percent had been on probation or parole. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Youth with emotional disturbances trail the general population in positive transition outcomes, and high rates of criminal justice system involvement suggest more effort is needed, including early intervening with response to intervention (RtI) strategies and self-determination training, to help these young adults succeed after high school.},

Gaps in the literature include limitations linked to measurement of discrimination, research designs, and inattention to the way in which the association between discrimination and health unfolds over the life course.

  abstract = {This Monte Carlo simulation study investigated different strategies for forming product indicators for the unconstrained approach in analyzing latent interaction models when the exogenous factors are measured by unequal numbers of indicators under both normal and nonnormal conditions. Product indicators were created by (a) multiplying parcels of the larger scale by items of the smaller scale, and (b) matching items according to reliability to create several product indicators, ignoring those items with lower reliability. Two scaling approaches were compared where parceling was not involved: (a) fixing the factor variances, and (b) fixing 1 loading to 1 for each factor. The unconstrained approach was compared with the latent moderated structural equations (LMS) approach. Results showed that under normal conditions, the LMS approach was preferred because the biases of its interaction estimates and associated standard errors were generally smaller, and its power was higher than that of the unconstrained approach. Under nonnormal conditions, however, the unconstrained approach was generally more robust than the LMS approach. It is recommended to form product indicators by using items with higher reliability (rather than parceling) in the matching and then to specify the model by fixing 1 loading of each factor to unity when adopting the unconstrained approach.},

  abstract = {We estimated measurement error (ME) associated with 15 skeletal characters in seven species of passerine birds. The total sample variance of the characters, from three measurements of each character on each individual, was partitioned into among- and within-individual components of variation. Measurement error, defined as that portion of the total sample variance made up by within-individual variation, ranged from {$<$}1\% to {$>$}80\%. Percent ME was inversely related to the size of a character, among-individual variation, and experience of the measurer. Other sources of ME included the character's flexibility and the definition of character landmarks. Although observer experience reduced ME, the effect was only substantial after more specimens were measured than are often used in morphometric studies. The magnitude of statistically detectable differences between groups was examined in relation to the level of ME and the sample sizes of groups. Measurement error increased the chances of finding no group difference, i.e., making type II errors. Type II errors can be reduced either by averaging two or more repeated measurements of the same individual, thereby reducing ME, or by increasing the sample size. We show how averaging repeated measurements changes the minimum detectable effect size between groups when both ME and sample size vary. The pattern of character-specific measurement error is consistent across passerine species; both reliable and unreliable characters for morphometric studies are identified.},
